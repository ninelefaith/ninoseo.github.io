tagline: Faith‑Driven SEO & Web Design for Small Business Growth

"Faith-driven SEO and web design by NinoSEO—empowering small businesses with sleek, scalable websites that convert and reflect your purpose."
It’s within the recommended 150–160 character range and includes your core values, service focus, and brand name. Want variations that emphasize local SEO, automation, or the fact that you offer WhatsApp-based consulting? I’ve got your back.

Great, Nino! Now that your hero section is locked in and polished, the structure that follows should guide your visitor smoothly toward taking action—while showcasing your credibility, services, and values. Here's a recommended section-by-section layout tailored for your **NinoSEO one-page site**:

---

### 1. **Hero Section** ✅ *(Done)*  
Clear promise, purpose-driven intro, WhatsApp CTA.

---

### 2. **Services Overview**
List the key services you offer, focusing on outcomes. Three cards or blocks often work well.

**Example Headline:**  
_"Tailored SEO & Web Solutions That Actually Work"_

**Include:**  
- SEO Optimization (Local & On-Page)  
- Custom WordPress/Elementor Design  
- Branding + Copywriting Guidance  
- Automation Setup (optional based on your strength)

---

### 3. **Why Work With Me / Faith-Driven Promise**
A short personal section showing your values, style, and what sets NinoSEO apart.

**Optional angle:**  
_"Tech with Integrity. Design with Purpose."_  
_"Combining design, strategy, and faith to help businesses grow with clarity and conscience."_

---

### 4. **Testimonials or Social Proof**  
Even one or two quotes or a visual review screenshot can build immediate trust. If you're still collecting them, we could use a “What Clients Are Saying” placeholder block.

---

### 5. **Recent Work / Case Study Preview**  
Mini snapshots of projects or before/after images showing your skill—especially mobile-friendly layout, SEO improvements, or redesigns.

---

### 6. **FAQ Section** (Optional but great for SEO)  
Clarify expectations like:  
- “How long does a typical site take?”  
- “Do you offer maintenance?”  
- “Can I request updates later?”  
This also reduces back-and-forth in DMs.

---

### 7. **Final CTA / Contact Block**  
Another WhatsApp CTA or inquiry form—this time after they've scrolled and seen your value.

---

### 8. **Footer**  
Keep it light:  
- NinoSEO brand line or tagline  
- Email (if available)  
- Socials (Instagram, etc.)  
- Mini copyright note

---

Would you like me to build a wireframe-style version of these sections next, or focus on writing a particular one first—like Services or Why Work With Me? Let’s shape this into a scroll-worthy masterpiece.
